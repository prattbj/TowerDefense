# TowerDefense

# Overview

This is a game project so that I can practice using C++ and practice game logic.

This is a simple tower defense game in which you can place towers to defend against enemies that are attacking.

I intend to expand upon this game idea either with this code or by remaking it with something else and add a 1 vs 1
functionality to it.

# Development Environment

I used Raylib in Visual Studio 2022 using C++.

# Future Work

* Prevent towers from being placed on each other
* Add 1 v 1 game mode with online functionality
* Add more types of towers and enemies
* Organize classes into seperate namespaces
